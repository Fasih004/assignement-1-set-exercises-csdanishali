      <h2>The Upside Down</h2>
      <p>
        The Upside Down is a dark, parallel dimension that exists alongside our world. It is a place of decay and despair, inhabited by terrifying creatures like the <strong>Demogorgon</strong> and the <strong>Mind Flayer</strong>. The air is toxic, and the landscape is a twisted version of Hawkins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Upside Down is connected to our world through portals created by the Hawkins National Laboratory. These portals allow the creatures to enter our world, bringing chaos and destruction.

        <B>Beware:</B> Once you enter The Upside Down, there may be no way back...
